The darkness rose, as the light fled the night.

It was ominous, a beast barely contained, the night rose, and it's queen stood alone, above it all, as behind her the storm grew, the waves of her anger crashing on the cold waves of reality.

The only three people to have known her, loved her as she was, were gone.

Only her hate remained.

I originally published Lilly in 2012.

Now, I've decided to release it for free, or at least the eBook version.

You can grab a copy [here](https://shakna.keybase.pub/Lilly.epub).
