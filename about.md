I've been writing as long as I can remember, and world-building longer.

I tend to craft worlds of fantasy, be it magic or robotics.

In my other life, outside the books, I'm a father, and a programmer.

Ethics does come into play a fair bit in the programming world, where passwords are regularly asked to be bypassed by staff who have forgotten them, and a lot of other implications of having the power to do what the ordinary user can't.

There are ethical considerations where my books come into play.

Most eBooks today are locked by something called Digital Rights Management. It controls how many devices you can copy the book you *bought* to, and a few other things along those lines.

You won't find that with my books, unless you get them from Kindle, or another system where DRM is non-optional.

I believe that the very foundations of DRM are wrong.

Copy away, the book belongs to you.
