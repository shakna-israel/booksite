The Heart of Madness follows the tale of Bethia, a young girl orphaned by a war with a dragon, as she is placed between man and Fae, and worse as fate seems to strangle the life out of her world.

I originally published the Heart of Madness in December, 2014.

Now, I've decided to release it for free, or at least the eBook version.

You can grab a copy [here](https://shakna.keybase.pub/HeartOfMadness.epub).
