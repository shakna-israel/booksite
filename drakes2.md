Sequel to [Drakes](/drakes). Followed by [Drakes: Heroes and Villains](/drakes3).

Following "Drakes" this tale follows the recovery of Susan Ashley Drakes, and her subsequent mission to the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service.

Technology, intelligence, and terrorism collide in this short story, about a girl, with way too much on her plate.

I originally published Drakes: the Five Eyes in 2014.

Now, I've decided to release it for free, or at least the eBook version.

You can grab a copy [here](https://shakna.keybase.pub/Drakes2FiveEyes.epub).
