The world was born in fire.

It was destroyed by ice.

It was rebuilt by blood.

I originally published Necromancer's Apprentice online, for free, at [GitHub](https://github.com/shakna-israel/NecromancersApprentice).

The book is written under a different license than usual - allowing people to edit, and share as they see fit.

You can grab a copy [here](https://shakna.keybase.pub/necromancer-s-apprentice.epub).
